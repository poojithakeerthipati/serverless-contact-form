# Serverless Contact Form

A simple, efficient serverless contact form designed for cloud computing environments. This project allows users to submit inquiries via a contact form without requiring a dedicated backend server, leveraging cloud functions and storage for handling form submissions.

## Features
- Serverless Architecture: No need to manage servers; utilizes cloud functions for efficient handling.
- Secure Data Handling: Submissions are stored in cloud storage or sent securely to an email service.
- Spam Protection: Integrates basic spam protection mechanisms (e.g., reCAPTCHA).
- Customizable Form Fields: Easily modify fields as per requirements.
- Email Notification: Sends an email notification on each form submission (optional).
- Cost-Effective: Minimal costs due to the pay-as-you-go nature of serverless functions.

## Tech Stack
- Cloud Platform: AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, or Google Cloud Functions
- Cloud Storage: S3 Bucket (AWS), Blob Storage (Azure), or Google Cloud Storage for storing form data (optional)
- Email Service: AWS SES, SendGrid, or any SMTP email service for notification
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a simple form interface

## Architecture Overview
The project uses a serverless function to process form submissions. Once a user submits the form:
1. The data is validated and sent to the serverless function.
2. The function processes and stores the data in cloud storage or sends an email notification.
3. Optional: Spam protection is implemented using a CAPTCHA service to filter out unwanted submissions.

## Prerequisites
- Cloud Account: AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud account for creating serverless functions and storage buckets.
- Email Service: Set up with your email provider (e.g., AWS SES or SendGrid API keys).

## Setup and Deployment

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/poojithakeerthipati/serverless-contact-form.git
cd serverless-contact-form
```

### Step 2: Configure Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following details:
```env
EMAIL_SERVICE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME=your_bucket_name_here
CAPTCHA_SECRET_KEY=your_captcha_secret_key_here
```

### Step 3: Deploy Serverless Function
Follow instructions for deploying on your chosen cloud platform:
- AWS: Use the [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) or [Serverless Framework](https://www.serverless.com/) to deploy to Lambda.
- Azure: Use [Azure Functions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-create-first-function).
- Google Cloud: Use [Google Cloud Functions](https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/deploying).

### Step 4: Configure Contact Form Frontend
Modify the HTML form in `index.html` to match your requirements. Point the form action to the URL of the deployed serverless function.

### Step 5: Testing
Once deployed, test the form by submitting test data. Check cloud storage or email for confirmation of form submissions.

## Usage
- Deploy the form on any static website hosting platform or integrate it within an existing web page.
- Form submissions trigger the serverless function to process and store the data or notify via email.

## Troubleshooting
- Missing submissions: Ensure environment variables are correctly set, and storage permissions are configured.
- Email issues: Check that your email service API keys are valid and SMTP configurations are correct.
- Deployment errors: Verify that the cloud environment is set up correctly, and required permissions are in place.
